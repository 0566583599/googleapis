  rules:
  - selector: google.cloud.location.Locations.GetLocation
    description: Gets information about a location.

  - selector: google.cloud.location.Locations.ListLocations
    description: Lists information about the supported locations for this service.

  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.GetIamPolicy
    description: |-
      Gets the access control policy for a resource. Returns an empty policy
      if the resource exists and does not have a policy set.

  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.SetIamPolicy
    description: |-
      Sets the access control policy on the specified resource. Replaces
      any existing policy.

      Can return `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, and `PERMISSION_DENIED`
      errors.

  - selector: google.iam.v1.IAMPolicy.TestIamPermissions
    description: |-
      Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource. If the
      resource does not exist, this will return an empty set of
      permissions, not a `NOT_FOUND` error.

      Note: This operation is designed to be used for building
      permission-aware UIs and command-line tools, not for authorization
      checking. This operation may "fail open" without warning.
