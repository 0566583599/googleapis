# Google APIs Preview Channel

This branch is meant for development of preview-level APIs and features.

## Overview

Google APIs are typically deployed as API services that are hosted
under different DNS names. One API service may implement multiple APIs
and multiple versions of the same API.

Google APIs use [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
version 3 (proto3) as their Interface Definition Language (IDL) to
define the API interface and the structure of the payload messages. The
same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC versions of the
API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols.
